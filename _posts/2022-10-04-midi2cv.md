### Background

Since the end of the last year I've been more into electronic music: noot only listening but trying
to understand and maybe produce it as well in some capacity.
I've always been interested in electronics, so to combine these two hobbies I've been building
this [DIY modular synth kit][erica-diy]
from Erica Synths.

One issue with this kit is that I can't really connect it to my computer or any other gear because
it uses analog [CV][cv-wiki] signals, but I need digital [MIDI][midi] to connect it to a computer.

### MIDI to CV

Solution is to build a thing that reads digital MIDI signals and converts them into analog CV
values. The idea is pretty simple: you use an Arduino to read MIDI, which is just a serial protocol
at a rate of 31.25 kbit/s, parse the messages and convert them to CV values for a specific output.

Specifically I'm interested in the following:

* **Trigger** - when a note key is pressed, send a short CV value of 5V to *trigger* output.
* **Notes** - when a note key is pressed, send a value of the note to the *note* output (1V per octave).
* **Gate** - send a high signal (5V) to the *gate* output during the time a note key is pressed.
* **Clock** - for synchronizing the gear, for every clock message send a short CV value of 5V to *clock*
  output.

Other things that can be useful, but are not currently in the main scope are:

* **Pitch bend** - most MIDI keyboards have a [Pitch Wheel][pitch-bend] which can be used to modify the
  pitch of the notes playing.
* **Velocity** - most MIDI keyboards can detect how hard the key was struck.
* **CC** - bunch of different [parameters][midi-cc] that can be read from a MIDI controller, depending
  on what controller you are using.

Outputs are standard 3.5mm audio sockets that I can easily connect to the modular synth using
TS [Audio cables][audio-cable].

### Components

To build the converter I need the following components:

* MIDI input
* Analog/digital outputs
* A platform that connects those

### Platform

I chose [Arduino Nano Every][nano-every] since I had one lying around, it is powerful enough and it
has
everything I need: it can read serial protocol for MIDI input and it can output digital signals that
I need for the analog output. Arduino has a function called [analogWrite][analog-write] , but it's
actually just outputting a PWM signal since Arduino doesn't have a built in [DAC][dac].
Plus it doesn't take up as much room as a bigger Arduino would.

### MIDI input

In theory MIDI is just a serial protocol which the Arduino Nano Every talks very well, but you need
to isolate the input to prevent [ground loops][ground-loops]. For this you can use a
simple [optocoupler][optocoupler] based circuit between your MIDI input and Arduino.

### Digital outputs

Gate, trigger and clock have two discrete values, so I can use the digital outputs of the Arduino to
trigger those.

### Analog outputs

Note (with pitch bend, velocity and CC) output needs more than 2 levels so a digital output is not
enough: I need an
analog output, so I need to add a [DAC][dac]. Digital to
analog conversion is basically just outputting different levels of a reference voltage
based on the resolution of the DAC. For example if you have an 8-bit DAC and reference voltage of
12V you can output 256 different levels from 0-12. For pitch bend I think you would need something
with a higher resolution like 12-bit, but I have some 8-bit DAC's, and I'm thinking that since I
only
need about 88 levels to output all the note values I need then maybe it is enough? Let's see.

### Buffering

All the outputs need to be [buffered with opamps][opamp-buffer]. Think of it like adding a boundary
between the converter and anything that is connected to the outputs: instead of current running from
your Arduino outputs (might not be that powerful) to the input of the connected device, the opamp
will provider the current while maintaining the voltage level of the output.

### References

There are a bunch of already made projects out there. One that I've been using for ideas is
this [MIDI 2 CV converter][midi2cv].
