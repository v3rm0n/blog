### Background

A while back my colleagues and me had some free time so we had an idea to build an [app][secdrive]
that enables you to use a [Yubikey][yubikey-5] to encrypt/decrypt files using any Android/iOS phone
available as long as you have your Yubikey with you.

### Creating the app

Our platform of choice is always [Flutter][flutter]. Unfortunately it didn't have a plugin for
communicating with a Yubikey, so we [built that][yubikit-flutter]. It allows you to use low
level [APDU][apdu] commands to communicate with a Yubikey (or any smart card that uses the same
standards).

In addition to that we needed implement the high level stuff: Yubikey implements
the [OpenPGP Smart Card][openpgp-smartcard] standard for communicating with it. Yubikeys also
support [PIV standard][piv], but PIV only supports US government approved elliptic curves which do
not include the currently recommended [Curve25519][curve25519]. Since we started with it, the plugin
has PIV support built in as well. For OpenPGP we built another [Dart library][yubikit-openpgp] which
implements some common OpenPGP smart card specification compliant actions you can take on your smart
card. It doesn't depend on the Flutter plugin so it can be used on other platforms as well if
needed.

Originally we wanted to go with [OpenPGP][openpgp] as the encryption standard for communication
because that's what the Yubikey uses, but we really didn't enjoy working with the standard so we
found an alternative: [age encryption][age]. Why? Because [age specification][age-spec] is really
easy to follow and since there weren't any OpenPGP implementations on Flutter that we could use.
There is [this][flutter-openpgp], but it doesn't support GNU PGP extensions that are used on your
computer to trigger the smart card for encryption/signing actions so we would have needed to write
our own OpenPGP implementation which is pretty crazy.

Instead we built [dage][dage]: a Dart implementation of age encryption that is fully v1 spec
compliant and open sourced it so it can be used by anybody. One of our goals from the start was that
if for some reason we go out of business or our app is taken down you could still decrypt your data,
so we built an option into dage to run it as a CLI program and use your Yubikey with your computer
to decrypt the data. Of course this is mostly useful when you use your own data storage (or you have
exported the encrypted files at any point the app was available) and not the one provided by us, but
this feature is currently in the backlog.

### Problems we faced

- NFC is pretty unreliable for doing things that take time since you need to position the token
  behind your phone and not move it in any way for the duration of the action, so things like
  generating RSA keys is not really doable
- Renamed our app from Yubidrive to Secdrive (for now) for obvious reasons :)
- When you create an iOS app that uses a hardware device over [Lightning][lightning], the hardware
  manufacturer needs to give you approval to use it, so you need to [register][app-approval] your
  app and wait for a review, which for us took a few weeks

### Conclusion

- We built a [Flutter plugin][yubikit-flutter] for YubiKit
- We built a [Dart library][yubikit-openpgp] that
  implements [OpenPGP smartcard interface][openpgp-smartcard]
- We built a [Dart library][dage] that implements [age encryption][age]
- Finally we built the [app][secdrive]

At some point I would like to write more about each of the open source components in separate blog
posts as well so stay tuned!
