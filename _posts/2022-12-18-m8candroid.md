title:  "Dirtywave M8 client for Android"
tags: software hardware music android java c
---

Recently I purchased an awesome [tracker][tracker] called [Dirtywave M8][m8]. I have a few pieces or hardware (and
software) that can be used to create music, but it's pretty hard to find a piece of hardware that is both powerful and
has a small form factor. I think M8 fits this description nicely: it's a hugely powerful (you can
create [full albums][rituals] on it) music creation device that you
can use even when riding on a bus.

Because of the global chip shortage it's pretty hard to manufacture this device in the quantities that are demanded so
the creator of M8, [Timothy Lamb][trash80], decided to release a [version][m8-headless] of the M8 firmware that you can
install on a [Teensy][teensy] yourself, if you can get your hands on one. Then you just need to connect it to a device
that can run a version of the client software that will provide the GUI and input/output for the device. The most
popular headless clients are [m8c][m8c] and the web based [M8WebDisplay][m8-web-display]. This is pretty useful if you
plan on using it for your computer or if you have an [Anbernic][anbernic] or similar
console somewhere.

This got me thinking: what if you can use your phone as a client for the M8 since you probably have one already?
Unfortunately iPhones are ruled out completely because they don't allow you to access USB devices. Not all iPads
though because newer iPads with M1 processors do support DriverKit which means you can write your own driver to
communicate with USB devices.

This leaves us with Android: yes, you can use M8WebDisplay on Android devices as well, but you will not have audio.

## M8C for Android

M8C is an M8 headless client that uses [SDL][sdl] and [libserialport][libserialport] to communicate with the M8 and
provide GUI. Since SDL is ported to a lot of platforms, one of them being Android, it seemed like it would be quite easy
to get it to run (spoiler: it was not).

To get the SDL part of the m8c running on Android was actually quite simple with [Android NDK][ndk]. There's even a
skeleton of a working Android project included in SDL that you can copy/paste and start modifying for your own purposes.

### GUI

Biggest issue initially was actually libserialport because it assumes you have direct access to serial devices (
under `/dev/tty*`) which you do not under an unrooted Android device. I needed another way to access a USB device that
is connected to the Android phone with an OTG cable. Luckily such a project exists, also on many platforms,
called [libusb][libusb]. Unfortunately, libusb can't be used directly as well, because in Android you need to first ask
for a permission to access the USB device from the Java side of the code, open a connection to the device, and then you
can pass a file descriptor to the native code that can use it to communicate.

Luckily libusb supports it by having a `libusb_wrap_sys_device` which accepts a file descriptor and wraps it to
a `libusb_device_handle` that you can use to call all the libusb API's. Since libusb is not Android specific, it seemed
like a good idea to contribute it to upstream and open a [PR][m8c-libusb] on m8c to support different ways to
communicate with an M8 device.

At this point we can see the GUI on the phone:

### Input

This was pretty cool, but not that useful because you can't interact with the device in any way. For that we need to add
some buttons to the screen layout and pass the touch events to the input event processing mechanism of m8c.

The button logic itself is quite simple: every button maps to a bit in an 8-bit byte and since any button can basically
be a modifier for any other button you need to keep track of all the buttons currently pressed. Enum for buttons in Java
can look something like this:

```java
import java.util.Set;

enum M8Key {
  EDIT(1),
  OPTION(1 << 1),
  RIGHT(1 << 2),
  PLAY(1 << 3),
  SHIFT(1 << 4),
  DOWN(1 << 5),
  UP(1 << 6),
  LEFT(1 << 7);

  private final int code;

  M8Key(int code) {
    this.code = code;
  }

  public char getCode(Set<M8Key> modifiers) {
    return (char) modifiers.stream()
      .map(t -> t.code)
      .reduce(code, (in, out) -> in | out)
      .intValue();
  }
}
```

When button goes down you add it to a list of modifiers and submit the code to m8c. When button goes up you send a 0
code.

This is what it looks like with added buttons:

### Audio

On to the hardest part: audio. Theoretically it should be quite simple to get the audio to work since it's just a class
compliant USB audio device, but there is no audio when you connect the device and whatever I have tried there is no easy
way to get it to work. It might be my lack of Android knowledge. Current theory is that since the M8 has both audio
output and input, the output will just get redirected to the input, and you will not hear anything, but I'm not 100%
sure
that's the case.

The way I did get it to work was to use libusb to connect to the audio interface of the M8 device (thanks
to [this][usbaudio] project) and pass raw audio
data from it to the SDL Audio functionality by opening the default audio output device
using [SDL_OpenAudio][sdl-openaudio] and [SDL_QueueAudio][sdl-queueaudio]. At this point audio worked on my test device.
I built a pre-release version and published it to GitHub and tried to get some feedback from M8 Discord.

It turned out that the audio was not working for some, so I tested with another (older) Android device and also didn't
have any audio. After a bit of hacking I found out that instead of using the default output, I had to set a preferred
device to be the speakerphone to get the audio to work. Luckily SDL has another function
called [SDL_OpenAudioDevice][sdl-openaudiodevice] that can be used to choose a specific audio device and not just the
default one.

Unfortunately for me, it turned out that none of the Android drivers (SDL has three: AAudio, openSLES and Android)
actually supported choosing a device! After a bit of digging in SDL code I decided to go all in and try to add the
possibility to choose an audio device on Android platforms to SDL. I don't have much C experience, but I found the
abstractions in SDL pretty easy to follow. I managed to throw something together and opened a [PR][sdl-pr] which was
merged pretty quickly, but there are still some issues to be solved.

And now with audio:

It still doesn't work on some devices, but I hope it is due to my bad understanding of C and if we fix the issues in SDL
then maybe it starts working.

## Conclusion

Trying to build what seemed to be a simple wrapper for an existing application turned out to be a multi week journey
going down different rabbit holes, but at the same time I have been learning quite a lot and I managed to contribute
back to a few open source projects.
