My name is Maido.

I've been a software developer since 2008. Currently employed at [Lightyear](https://lightyear.com), dealing with
everything Java/Kotlin, Spring Boot, React, AWS, Postgres, Kafka, Flutter related.

Interested in software and all analog/digital electronics (including music).

I started this blog because
when I'm writing about a topic I need to understand it more than when I'm just hacking stuff. It
forces me to focus more and learn why instead how and not to blindly follow
instructions on the internet.
