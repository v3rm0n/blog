My name is Maido.

I've been a software developer since 2008.
Freelance consultant at [Enum][enum].

Interested in software and all analog/digital electronics (including music).

I started this blog mainly because I find when I'm writing about things I need to understand them
first so it forces me to focus more and learn instead of blindly following instructions on the
internet.
